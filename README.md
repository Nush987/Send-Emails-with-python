# Sending Automated Emails Using Python

Follow these steps to enable your Python script to send automated emails:

1. **Set Up Your Email Account for SMTP:**
   - Ensure your email account allows "Less Secure Apps" or has SMTP access enabled.
   - For Gmail:  
     - Enable "Less Secure Apps" from your [Google Account Security settings](https://myaccount.google.com/security).
     - If using 2-Step Verification, generate an "App Password" instead.

2. **Install Required Libraries:**
   - Ensure `smtplib` is available (usually built-in).
   - Install any necessary dependencies:
     ```bash
     pip install secure-smtplib
     ```

3. **Run the Email Script:**
   - Save your script (e.g., `send_email.py`).
   - Run the script:
     ```bash
     python send_email.py
     ```

4. **Security Notes:**
   - Avoid storing sensitive information like passwords directly in the script. Use environment variables for better security.
   - Ensure your network settings allow outgoing SMTP connections (e.g., port 465 for Gmail).
